# Discussion

* Interpretation
  * TBD based on results

* Issues
  * Need a more detail exploration of rate of false pos/neg: affected by p.dist, R, Q, P0 -- how much do we need to simulate?
  * Would like to add look-back capabilities (ensemble backward smoothing) to update assignments based on more recent info
    * related: with multi-PFT need to check for, and protect against, long term PFT leakage
  * Computational demand it high for problems with many grid cells
    * Efficient (semi-)analytic approximations or LUT
    * work at larger spatial scales and account for subgrid disturbance heterogeneity implicitly [@McCabe]
  * Multisite needs a way of estimating $\rho$ by site with cross site correlations, rather than unique $\rho$ for all permutations
    * for $\rho$ handle the covariances of nearby sites -- disturbance in one usually increases the probability of disturbance in others
    * similarly, need to be able to compose Multisite $\mu_f$ and $P_f$, from individual site values with reasonable approximations of cross-[site x pool] correlations

* Discussion of similar approaches

* Implications  (borrow text from CMS proposals)
  * Improving MRV
  * Recovery forecasting
  * Disturbance nowcasting
    * requires reducing temporal resolution

* Future directions
  * Disturbance priors need to be spatially heterogenous and evolve temporally
    * Connect to state-and-transition literature
  * Scaling up -> spatially implicit
    * ED2
    * Contagion
