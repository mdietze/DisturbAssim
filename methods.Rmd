1. Illustration of problem
2. Derivation Multinomial

*Priors*

  $$X^L_k \sim MVN(\vec{\mu}_{f,k},P_{f,k})$$
  $$\vec{\rho} \sim Multinomial(\vec{p})$$ 
*Process Model*

  $$X = X^L \vec{\rho}$$
  
*Likelihood*
  $$Y \sim MVN(X,R)$$

3. Simulated data experiments (known disturbance)
  + x Single Site, Single Disturbance  (add a case where EnKF has disturb but it's more rare)
  + x SSSD Multi Pool
  + x SS Multi-Disturbance - distinct
  + SS Multi-Disturbance w/ distinct, PFT switching
  + SSMD - initially overlapping but diverge
      * how to handle updating of assignment based on new information?
  + SSMD - transition probabilities change with state
  + Simple Multi-site: spatial cov
  + rate of false pos/neg: affected by p.dist, R, Q, P0 -- how much do we need to simulate?
4. Real-world examples
  + Describe Model & PEcAn
  + Calibrate state-and-transition prior
    + Landtrendr

  + Applications: PNW
    + Logging
    + Fire
    + Land use transition (forest -> non?)

Email to Robert:

I need to extract some example time series for single pixels (e.g. AGB product) where the disturbance it is far enough in the past that there’s an interesting recovery trajectory but also where it’s not so early (so that the data assimilation has time to come into steady-state before the disturbance). From Landtrendr itself I’m looking to know when you attributed the year, severity, and cause so we can see if our assimilation is getting it “right”. Bonus would be if you could suggest places where you know there’s ground data we could use to validate the model (disturbances at flux towers, LTER sites, FIA plots, etc).
