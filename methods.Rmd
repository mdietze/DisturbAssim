# Methods

1. Illustration of problem
2. Derivation Multinomial

*Priors*

  $$X^L_k \sim MVN(\vec{\mu}_{f,k},P_{f,k})$$
  $$\vec{\rho} \sim Multinomial(1,\vec{p})$$ 
*Process Model*

  $$X = X^L \vec{\rho}$$
  
*Likelihood*
  $$Y \sim MVN(X,R)$$
### Ensemble Adjustment

[@Anderson2001]

*reassignment of classes*

To reassign forecasted ensemble members to new disturbance classes we first identify those that decreased between the prior probability, $p_k$, and the posterior frequency, $\bar{\rho}_k$.

$$\delta p_k = max\{0,\bar{\rho}_k-p_k \}$$

Classes that decreased in relative abundance are reassigned to new classes according to a Multinomial draw

$$c_{A|k} = Multinomial\left( n_k, {{\delta p}\over{\sum \delta p}}  \right)$$ 



*Ensemble adjustment by class*

3. Simulated data experiments (known disturbance)
  + x Single Site, Single Disturbance  (add a case where EnKF has disturb but it's more rare)
  + x SSSD Multi Pool
  + x SS Multi-Disturbance - distinct
  + x SS Multi-Disturbance w/ distinct, PFT switching
      * mention parallel PFT ensembles
      * need to protect against long-term PFT leakage; related to more general need to "look back"
  + Simple Multi-site: spatial cov
  + SSMD - initially overlapping but diverge
      * how to handle updating of assignment based on new information?
  + SSMD - transition probabilities change with state
  + rate of false pos/neg: affected by p.dist, R, Q, P0 -- how much do we need to simulate?
4. Real-world examples

  + Calibrate state-and-transition prior

    + Land use transition (forest -> non?)

Email to Robert:

I need to extract some example time series for single pixels (e.g. AGB product) where the disturbance it is far enough in the past that there’s an interesting recovery trajectory but also where it’s not so early (so that the data assimilation has time to come into steady-state before the disturbance). From Landtrendr itself I’m looking to know when you attributed the year, severity, and cause so we can see if our assimilation is getting it “right”. Bonus would be if you could suggest places where you know there’s ground data we could use to validate the model (disturbances at flux towers, LTER sites, FIA plots, etc).
